      <h1>TexasHoldem-Poker.com's "Official" Texas Holdem Rules</h1><div class="center">(<a href="http://www.texasholdem-poker.com/holdem_rules?printview=true">Printer-Friendly version</a>)</div><br>
    
<div align="left"> <p>       1. The organizer of the tournament is 
to consider the best interest of the game and fairness as the top priority in 
the decision-making process. Unusual circumstances can, on occasion, dictate 
that the technical interpretation of the rules be ignored in the interest of 
fairness. Their decision is final.<br> </p> <h3>Betting Procedures</h3><p> 
 2. The action of betting is physically defined as the release of chips 
after a single, forward motion.<br> <br> 3. Above all, verbal declarations in 
turn are binding. A player who declares a call, raise, fold, must do so to the 
limit that the chips allow. If simultaneous declarations are made (tossing in a 
raise and saying call), the verbal declaration takes precedence.<br> <br> 4. 
Action out of turn is not binding. The deliberate intention to act out of turn 
may result in a penalty.<br><br> 5. 
Check-raising (checking, then later raising over a bet) is allowed.<br> <br> 6. 
<a href="http://www.texasholdem-poker.com/string-betting">String betting</a> (placing out bets with more than one motion without verbally 
declaring your intention) is forbidden. Any betting motions after the first 
motion will be dismissed. <br> <br> 7. In no limit or pot limit, by stating the 
word "raise", a player protects his right to raise, but the raise must be made 
in one additional motion unless he states the amount.<br> <br> 8. In no limit or 
pot limit, a bet must be at least the amount of the big blind. <br> <br> 9. In 
no limit or pot limit, a raise must be at least the amount of the previous 
bet.<br> <br>    9a. If a player puts in a bet below the minimum 
allowed that is equal<br> 
         or above 
50%, the player will be required to make a full raise. The raise<br> 
         will be 
exactly the minimum raise allowed. If a player cannot cover the<br> 
         full 
minimum raise, he or she must go all-in.<br> <br>    9b. If a 
player puts in an amount that is less than 50% of the minimum<br> 
         allowed 
bet, the player is considered to have called and is returned <br>
         the 
excess chips. <br> <br> 10. In limit hold em, there will be a max limit of a bet, 
a raise, a reraise, and another reraise. When only two players are involved in a 
hand this betting "cap" does not apply.<br> <br> 11. When a player throws in an 
oversized chip without making a verbal declaration...<br> <br> 
   11a. In limit hold 'em, an oversized chip will be considered to 
be a<br> 
         call.<br> <br>    11b. In no-limit, before the flop, an oversized chip is 
a call.<br> <br>    11c. In no limit, after the flop, an 
oversized chip <b><i>by the initial<br> 
         bettor</i></b> will 
constitute the size of the bet.<br> <br>    11d. In 
no limit, after the flop, an oversized chip <b><i>by a player<br> 
         facing a 
bet</i></b> will be considered a call.<br> <br>    11e. In no 
limit, if a player states just the word "raise" and throws in<br> 
         an 
oversized chip, the raise will be that amount. <br> <br>    11f. 
In pot-limit, if a player states just the word "raise" and throws in<br> 
         an 
oversized chip, the raise will be the maximum amount<br> 
         allowable up to the size
 of that chip. <br> </p>

      </div>

 <h3>Split Pots, Side Pots, and going 
All-in</h3><p> 12. A player who is all-in must show his cards at the 
showdown.<br> <br> 13. In the case of a split pot when there are two or more 
high hands, the chip(s) will be split as evenly as possible (chips may need to 
be broken down into smaller denominations) with any odd chip(s) left over given 
out to the winning player with the worst position (left of the button being the 
worst).<br> <br> 14. Each side pot will be split as a separate pot. They will 
not be mixed together before they are split. <br> <br> 15. When a player creates 
a side pot by going all-in, the side pot will be the current pot plus each call 
up to the amount of the all-in. Any raises (or calls in the case of a below-the-
limit all-in) go into the new pot. <br> <br> 16. At the showdown with a side 
pot, the player who is all-in can only win the pot set aside when he or she went 
all-in. After the winner of that hand is resolved, the players involved in the 
main pot determine the winner without regard to the all-in hand. <br> <br> 17. 
In case of multiple side pots, a player can only win up to what he put in times 
the number of calls up to the all-in amount. <br> </p> <h3>Blinds and Antes</h3><p>
18. Players must post blinds and antes before cards are dealt.<br><br> 
19. If a player does not have enough to cover his 
blind/ante, a side pot is created before cards are dealt and...<br> <br> 
   19a. In an ante only game, the side pot will equal the amount 
of the<br> 
            all-in 
times the number of players.<br> <br>    19b. In a blind only 
game, the side pot will equal the amount of the<br> 
            all-in 
times the number of callers.<br> <br>    19c. In a game with 
blinds AND antes, if the player can call the<br> 
            ante and 
part of the blind, the side pot will equal the amount<br> 
            of the 
ante times the number of player PLUS the amount of the<br> 
            remainin
g all-in blind times the number of callers.<br> <br>    19d. In a 
game with blinds AND antes, if the player can call all or<br> 
            part of 
the ante but no part of the blind, the side pot will equal<br> 
            the 
amount of the all-in times the number of players and the<br> 
            blind 
will be absent.<br> <br> 20. When heads up, the blinds are reversed. The player 
on the button has the small blind.<br> <br> 21. In the hand after a big blind is
eliminated, the button will move normally and there will be no small blind. The
following hand, the button will move into the position where the eliminated 
player was, creating a dead button situation. <br> <br> 
 22. In the hand after a small blind is eliminated, the button will move 
into the position where the eliminated player was, creating a dead button 
situation.<br><br> 23. In the hand after both blinds are eliminated, the button 
will move into the position where the former small blind was and there will be no 
small blind. The following hand, the button will move into the position where the 
former big blind was.<br><br> 24. Through players being eliminated, no player 
should miss a big or small blind.<br></p><h3>Chips</h3><p>
<br> 25. All chips must 
be visibly displayed at all times. Players may not have tournament chips in 
their pockets at any time. A player who has chips in his pocket will forfeit the 
chips. The forfeited chips will be taken out of play from the tournament. Any 
other form of "ratholing" will be dealt with similarly. <br> <br> 26. Players 
must keep their highest denomination chips visible at all times.<br> <br> 27. 
There will be no foreign chips allowed on the table.<br> <br> 28. At the request 
of the dealer, a player must exchange his or her chips for chips of a different 
denomination. <br> </p> <h3>Killing a Hand / Dead Hands</h3><p> 29. 
Another player may call for a clock against a player who is taking an 
unreasonable amount of time to make a decision. <br> <br>    29a. 
Once a clock is called for, the player with action will be given one minute <br>
         
to make a decision. If a decision has not been made by the time the<br>
         
minute is over, there will be a 10-second countdown. If a player<br>
         
has not acted on his hand by the time the countdown is over, the hand<br>
         
 will be dead.
<br> <br>    29b. A player 
who calls "time" will act on the same rules as above.<br><br> 30. If a live player leaves 
during a hand, there will be no minute countdown and the hand will be declared 
dead.<br> <br> 31. A player must be in their seat by the time all players have 
complete hands in order to have a live hand. Otherwise the blinds/antes will be 
forfeited and the hand will be killed. <br> <br> 32. If a live hand touches the 
muck, it will immediately be ruled dead.<br><br> 33. If a dealer kills an unprotected 
hand, the player will have 
no redress and will not be entitled to his money back. An exception would be if 
a player raised and his raise had not been called yet, he would be entitled to 
receive his raise back.<br> <br> 34. Dealers cannot kill a winning hand that was 
turned face up and was obviously the winning hand. <br> </p> <h3>Verbal 
Discussion</h3><p> 35. Verbally disclosing the true contents of your 
hand will cause the hand to be killed and a penalty will be assessed.<br> <br> 
   35a. A player cannot verify the contents of a live hand that 
was verbally<br> 
            disclosed.
  Only a director or floorperson may check those<br> 
            contents 
after the hand is over, but before the pot has been<br> 
            awarded. 
If the hand is verified but is not in violation of<br> 
            the 
previous rule, the contents will not be revealed by the<br> 
            floor or 
director to anyone.<br> <br>    35b. If a verbally disclosed hand 
is killed through verification after the<br> 
            hand, 
the pot goes to the best hand among the remaining players<br> 
            at the 
showdown, or to the last player to fold.<br> <br>    35c. By 
definition, verbal disclosure must include the actual ranks or<br> 
            suits, 
or any synonym to the ranks or suits.  Nicknames for<br> 
            specific 
two-hand combinations like "Big Slick" or "American<br> 
            
Airlines" will also constitute verbal disclosure. <br> 
            
Furthermore, only a definitive declaration will constitute<br> 
            a verbal 
disclosure.  Language like "may", "might", or "could"<br> 
            could 
nullify a declaration as verbal disclosure.<br> <br>
36. Advising a player how to play a hand may result in a penalty. <br> <br> 
37. Verbal declarations as 
to the content of a player's hand at the showdown are not binding (<a href="http://www.texasholdem-poker.com/cards_speak">cards speak</a>); 
however at management's discretion, any player deliberately miscalling his hand 
to induce other players to reveal their cards may be penalized.<br> <br> 38. 
Players are obligated to protect the other players in the tournament at all 
times. Discussing cards discarded or hand possibilities is not allowed. <br> 
</p> <h3>Exposing Cards</h3><p> 39. During the initial deal, if any 
pocket card is exposed due to dealer error, it is a misdeal.<br> <br> 40. A 
player who exposes his cards during the play may incur a penalty, but will not 
have his hand killed. If any player at the table saw the exposed cards, any 
other player has a right to know what the exposed card or cards were.  If a 
player unintentionally exposes his cards during play, his hand will not be ruled 
dead.  If any player at the table saw the exposed card(s), then any other player 
at the table has the right to know what the exposed card(s) was.<br> <br> 41. At 
the showdown players begin the show their cards starting with the player to the 
left of the last to call. A player may "muck" his cards if they cannot win over 
a previously shown hand. If the house suspects cheating or collusion, you may be 
asked to expose your cards to the dealer, coordinator, and/or the other 
players.<br> <br> 42. Any player <i>who is live during the showdown</i> may ask 
to see both pocket cards from a player who reveals only one. <br> <br> 43. Any 
player may ask another player to reveal his or her 
pocket cards if they were exposed to any player at the table. <br> <br> 44. A 
player may <b>not</b> ask to see both pocket cards from another player who 
revealed them to a spectator. <br> </p> <h3>Penalty Situations</h3><p> 
 45. Penalties available for use by the tournament organizers are verbal 
warnings, 10, 20, 30, and 40 minutes away from the table and may be used with 
discretion. These may be utilized up to and including disqualification. A player 
who is disqualified shall have his chips removed from play. <br> <br> 46. A 
penalty may be invoked if a player exposes any card with action pending, if a 
card(s) goes off the table, if soft-play occurs, or similar incidents take 
place. Penalties WILL be invoked in cases of abuse, disruptive behavior, or 
similar incidents.<br> </p> <h3>Going up in Levels and Chip Racing</h3><p> 
47. When time has elapsed in a round and a new round is announced, the new 
limits apply to the next hand. The hand begins when the first card is dealt. 
<br> <br> 48. Excessive stalling during a hand to receive a favorable position 
prior to a limit change may result in a penalty. <br> <br> 49. As levels 
progress it may be necessary to exchange chips of a low denomination for chips 
of a higher denomination. When this happens, players may have odd chips. These 
are chips which, due to an insufficient sum, cannot be traded to the higher 
denomination. To determine what happens with these odd chips, a "chip race" is 
performed by the dealer.<br> <br>    49a. Players trade in their 
odd chips for an equal value of higher<br> 
            denomination chips. <br> <br>
    49b. Any leftover chips that cannot be 
traded in will be part of the<br> 
            
chip race. These chips are placed in the middle and are<br> 
            
collectively traded for chips of the next highest value. Any<br> 
            
remainder is removed. <br> <br>    49c. Starting with the small blind of 
the next hand, each player who<br> 
            lost an 
odd chip is dealt a single card. The highest card wins<br> 
            the 
race. In the case of a tie, the player who was dealt the<br> 
            high 
card first will win. (So the first ace dealt wins)<br> <br> 
   49d. Starting with the winner of the race and continuing 
around the<br> 
            table, 
each player who was dealt a card is given a new<br> 
            higher-
denomination chip from the middle until there are no<br> 
            chips 
left in the middle.<br> <br> 50. A player cannot be raced out of a tournament. 
In the event that a player has only one chip left, and loses the race, he will 
be given one chip of the smallest denomination still in play.<br> </p> 
<h3>Multi-table rules</h3><p> 51. Initial tournament and satellite 
seats will be randomly assigned.<br> <br> 52. Players going from a broken table 
to fill in seats assume the responsibilities of their new position. They may 
receive any position from blind to button. <br> <br> 53. The only place a moved 
player cannot be placed is between the small blind and the button. If it is 
necessary for a player to be moved to this position, that player must sit out 
that hand. <br> <br> 54. A player moved to balance two tables will be the player 
who will not lose position as a result of the move. Play may be halted 
temporarily to accommodate for the move. In a case where multiple seats are 
open, the worst positioned seats are the most preferable to be moved. <br> <br> 
55. A player who intentionally dodges his blind(s) when moving from a broken 
table will forfeit the blind(s) and/or incur a penalty. The money will be put 
into the next pot and will be considered dead money.<br> <br> 56. Prior to the 
"bubble" (the point where only a few more players must be eliminated for all 
remaining players to be guaranteed a portion of the prize pool), the tournament 
may be played "hand-for-hand". This means that each table will wait until all 
other tables finish their hands before starting another. This deters stalling by 
players in an attempt to place higher.<br> <br> 57. Hand-for-hand play may also 
be instituted during times where stalling to receive a higher place in the 
tournament would be advantageous to any player.<br> </p> <h3>Rebuy and Add-on 
Rules</h3> <p> 58. A player with no chips may not miss a hand.  If a 
player with no chips misses a hand, they lose their right to rebuy and are no 
longer able to participate in the tournament.<br> <br> 59. If a player announces 
intent to rebuy before the first card is dealt but does not have chips yet then 
that player is live, playing behind, and obligated to make the rebuy.<br> <br> 
60. Players can only rebuy between hands, under no circumstances will a player 
be allowed to make a rebuy when cards are out.<br> <br> 61.  If rebuys are 
permitted in situations where the player still has chips when the rebuy is made, 
that player must settle the rebuy completely to allow those additional chips 
into the next hand.  Thus a player is not permitted to play from behind if they 
have chips in front of them.<br> <br> 62.  If rebuys and add-ons are only 
permitted until a certain point in time, a player has until that point in time 
to provide funds for the rebuy.  If funds are presented at that time, then the 
player may rebuy and/or add-on.<br> </p> <h3>Miscellaneous Rules</h3><p> 
63. One player to a hand. During the hand, a player may not discuss play 
with other players, spectators, or the dealer. <br> <br> 64. English only at the 
table for games in the United States. <br> <br> 65. Players may not exchange 
chips for any reason. <br> <br> 66. A player who wants to use a cellular phone 
or any communication device must step away from the table.<br> <br> 67. A player 
may not leave a camera, cell phone, any recording instrument, or highly 
reflective item on the table. <br> <br> 68. Deck changes will be when there is a 
change of dealer or the limit changes. The house may additionally call for deck 
changes in other circumstances. Players may not ask for deck changes unless 
proof can be made that certain cards can be construed as "marked". <br> <br> 69. 
Rabbit hunting (asking to see additional board cards after play is over) is 
forbidden as it can give insight into players' hands by reducing the possible 
number of unknowns.<br> <br> 70. The tournament coordinator reserves the right 
to cancel or alter any event at its sole discretion in the best interest of the 
tournament and/or its players.<br> <br><br> </p> </div>
